## Descrption

This is my portfolio website project. Throughout the course of my class I will be making several projects and need a place to showcase them. This website will be where I link all my projects together. 

As well as a portfolio for my projects, I also wanted to create an about me seciton so people could read about me and my goals as a developer.
